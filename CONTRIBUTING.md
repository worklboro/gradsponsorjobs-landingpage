## Ground rules

- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Prefer accessibility and performance by default.
- Don’t include secrets (API keys, credentials) in commits.

## How to propose changes

1. Create a branch.
2. Make your changes with clear commit messages.
3. Open a pull request describing:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - How it was tested (if applicable)

## Code style

- Follow `.editorconfig`.
- Keep formatting consistent with the existing codebase.
