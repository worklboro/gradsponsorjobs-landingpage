# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately by emailing the repository owner/maintainer with:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or PoCs (if safe)

We’ll respond as soon as reasonably possible.
