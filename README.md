# Grad Sponsor Jobs

Grad Sponsor Jobs is a landing page (for now) that collects interest and basic details from candidates and employers. The long-term goal is to evolve into a full job board focused on graduate roles with visa sponsorship.

## Status

This repository is newly initialized and currently contains project scaffolding and documentation. The landing page and form implementation will be added next.

## Goals (MVP)

- A fast, accessible landing page
- A form to collect lead information (with clear consent)
- Basic spam protection
- A simple way to export/view submissions (implementation TBD)

## Roadmap (high level)

- Landing page + lead capture form
- Confirmation page / success state + email notifications (optional)
- Admin view + submissions export
- Job board: listings, search, employer posting flow
